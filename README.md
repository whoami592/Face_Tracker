# Face_Tracker
coded by Pakistani Ethical HAcker mr Sabaz ali khan 
Notes:
Dependencies: The code uses cv2 (OpenCV), face_recognition, and numpy. Ensure these are available in the Pyodide environment or installed locally (pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy).
Webcam Access: The script uses the default webcam (index 0). In a Pyodide environment, webcam access depends on browser permissions.
Banner Styling: The banner is a dark gray strip at the bottom with centered white text in a duplex font for a stylish look.
Pyodide Compatibility: The code avoids file I/O and network calls, using asyncio for frame rate control as per Pyodide guidelines.
Running Locally: If running outside Pyodide (e.g., on a desktop), the script displays the video feed in a window and exits on pressing 'q'.
Limitations: In Pyodide, cv2.imshow may not work directly; the environment must handle frame rendering. For local testing, it works as expected.
